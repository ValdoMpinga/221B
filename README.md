# Context

The web applicationt tha was developed owes its name to the 2 most famous in London, 21B Baker
Street, fictional address of Sherlock Holmes. Once the homage is done, we will easily reach the objective of the
application: finding "things", as Sherlock Holmes did.
This application will be especially useful for those who are more “distracted” who, when they save/clean up a little
thing, at home, you end up not knowing where it is when you need it most... Therefore, it should always be used
when we've put away/arranged something that, for some reason, we don't want to “lose out of sight” and we find it quickly.
An application must allow the management of small notes, typified (identified/classified
by given type) that allows one to create projects of several items,
books, among other things). Basically, it allows the registration of the item/location so, in case of
forgetfulness, will allow a quick location of a certain item, at home.
